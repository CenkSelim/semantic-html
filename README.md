# semantic-html
🤔 What is “semantic” HTML (recap)?
Semantic Code means code that is easy to draw or from.
This is particularly important with HTML, as Screen Readers use Semantic HTML tags to navigate and draw meaning from a web page for visually impaired users.
Search engine web crawlers also use HTML tags to get information from your page (for example the information in a pages <title> tags) to rank web pages in search results.
Using Semantic HTML makes web pages more accessible and improves SEO rankings.
 
🗺 The Task
For this task you will be given a set of User Specifications/Business Requirements for 2 separate Web Pages (a Doctors Surgery and a News article). Which Web Page you choose to create is up to you. You only need to choose ONE set of business requirements so pick either the Doctors Surgery OR the News Article.If you would like to create HTML for both pages then feel free! The more practice the better. But we are only expecting a submission for ONE of them.
❗️Note: This task is about Semantic HTML only. You do NOT need to use any CSS.
 
🤔 What do I have to do?
👉 Your job is to meet these user specifications/business requirements using Semantic HTML . The specifications are deliberately vague - it’s your job to identify which HTML elements would be the most appropriate to use!
